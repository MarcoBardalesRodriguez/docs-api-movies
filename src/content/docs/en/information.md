This is a **consumption-only** API — only the HTTP GET method is available on resources.

No authentication is required to access this API, and all resources are fully open and available. There is no cap on fees, but we still encourage you to limit the frequency of requests to limit our hosting costs.

## Fair Use Policy
PokéAPI is free and open to use. It is also very popular. Because of this, we ask every developer to abide by our fair use policy. People not complying with the fair use policy will have their IP address permanently banned.

PokéAPI is primarily an educational tool, and we will not tolerate denial of service attacks preventing people from learning.

Rules:

- Locally cache resources whenever you request them.
- Be nice and friendly to your fellow PokéAPI developers.
